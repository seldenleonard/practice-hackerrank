# INSTRUCTIONS
# An integer d is a divisor of an integer n if the remainder of n/d = 0.
# Given an integer, for each digit that makes up the integer determine whether it is a divisor. Count the number of divisors occurring within the integer.

# STEPS
# Create a function that accepts a single integer
# Set a counter equal to zero
# Loop through each digit of the integer and if the digit in question divides evenly (use modulo operator) into the input integer, then add 1 to the counter
# Return the counter
