# INSTRUCTIONS
# Given a sequence of n integers, p(1), p(2),..., p(n) where each element is distinct and satisfies 1 <= p(x) <= n. For each x where 1 <= x <= n, that is x increments from 1 to n, find any integer y such that p(p(y)) = xx and keep a history of the values of y in a return array.

# STEPS
# Given a sequence of positive, distinct integers do the following: using the values in the input array, and in the act of counting from 1 to the max value in ascending order, take each index and place it in a new array, with 1 (not 0) as the base index. Then return the array of indexes.
