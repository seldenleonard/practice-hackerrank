# We define a magic square to be an n * n matrix of distinct positive integers from 1 to n^2 where the sum of any row, column, or diagonal of length n is always equal to the same number: the magic constant.
# You will be given a 3 * 3 matrix s of integers in the inclusive range [1, 9]. We can convert any digit a to any other digit b in the range [1, 9] at cost of |a- b|. Given s, convert it into a magic square at minimal cost. Print this cost on a new line.
