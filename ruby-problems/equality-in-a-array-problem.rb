# Given an array of integers, determine the minimum number of elements to delete to leave only elements of equal value.
  # Example
  # arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]

# Delete the 2 elements 1 and 3 leaving arr = [2, 2]. If both twos plus either the 1 or the 3 are deleted, it takes 3 deletions to leave either [3] or [1]. The minimum number of deletions is 2.

# Function Description
