# Given a time in -hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.

# Note: - 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock is 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
# - 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock is 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.

# STEPS
# Create method that takes in a single string
# Use "if" statements and conditionals to change values at specific values within the string, by iterating through the string
# For exmaple: if str[0] and str[1] are "1" and "2", AND str[9] is "A" make str[0] and str[1] in the output "0" and "0"
